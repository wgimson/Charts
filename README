DESCRIPTION
This program takes an unlimited number of command-line inputs from the user and,
 using Processing, generates a bar graph from the provided information. The first
 two inputs are used for the width and height of the graph window, respectively.
 All subsequent inputs are taken as the heights of respective bars. Colors for the
 bars are randomly generated and will be different every time the program is run
 (in the sense that ever color in a finite repertoire is equally likely to occur
each time the porgram is run).
