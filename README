DESCRIPTION
This program takes an unlimited number of command-line inputs from the user and,
 using Processing, generates a bar graph from the provided information. The first
 two inputs are used for the width and height of the graph window, respectively.
 All subsequent inputs are taken as the heights of respective bars. Colors for the
 bars are randomly generated and will be different every time the program is run
 (in the sense that ever color in a finite repertoire is equally likely to occur
each time the program is run).

EXAMPLES
So, for example, if we were to run the program with command-line parameters 
300 400 23 455 56, the program would create a graph window of width 300, 
height 400, and consecutive, randomly colored bars of heights scaled proportional 
to a maximum height of 380 (i.e. the raw height 455 would be scaled down to 380,
and the two subsequent bars would be carry the same height relative to the tallest 
bar as they originally did).
